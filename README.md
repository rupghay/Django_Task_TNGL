1. For backend I have used Django Framework.
2. For forntend I have used CSS and Bootstrap for simple styling of HTML files(Templates).

Templates:

1. Index.html: It includes two buttons to view all customers list and to create new customer.

2. Customer List: It includes list of all customer with options to delete and update customer.

3. Create Customer: In this template we can create new customer which includes customer's name, address, number and meter serial number.
